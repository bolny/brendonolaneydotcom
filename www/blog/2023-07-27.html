      <p>
        I recently discovered a project called
        <a href="https://protoweb.org">Protoweb</a> which is an attempt to
        recreate the web as it existed in 1995. This was the time for me when I
        first got access to the internet over a blisteringly fast 33.6Kbaud
        modem so, of course, I needed to give it a try. However, it wasn’t
        enough for me to just browse on my shiny new computer with its
        anachronistically fast processor, no. I had to boot my favourite
        <a href="https://86box.net">x86 PC emulator</a>, install a copy of
        Windows 95 and experience things as they were in 1995, less the headache
        inducing CRT monitor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Windows 95 is amazingly usable. I had quickly put it through its paces
        doing some basic tasks. I had quickly managed to listen to my copy of
        Big Shiny Tunes 2 in a period accurate version of Winamp, draft some
        prose in Word 95, generate a graph in Excel, make a basic presentation
        in PowerPoint, and even compile some console and GUI applications in
        Visual C++. Something was missing, however. Browsing the
        <em>modern</em> internet using Netscape Navigator 2 is strictly off the
        table since it doesn’t support modern cryptography. There are some
        <a href="http://frogfind.com">workarounds</a> for the browsing issue,
        and of course <a href="https://protoweb.org">Protoweb</a> is
        <em>amazing</em>, but I wasn’t able to find a good way to send or
        receive email.
      </p>
      <p>
        Netscape Communicator only supports insecure
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol">POP3</a>
        and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol"
          >SMTP</a
        >
        and, so far as I can tell, there are no current email providers that
        allow for this configuration (with good reason). But, certainly, I
        should be able to send and receive email insecurely from a computer on
        my local network that has all the modern cryptography necessary to
        forward that email securely to my normal provider right?
      </p>
      <p><img src="../img/2023-07-27-01.png" /></p>
      <p>
        All that I need to do to make this system (relatively) secure is
        configure the bridge to only accept incoming connections from the local
        network; 192.168.0.0/16 in my case. Alpine Linux is my usual go to for
        containers/virtual machines these days. In this case I decided to use a
        virtual machine because I find them easier to mess around with when
        prototyping and idea. After installing the base system I just need to
        install a few packages:
      </p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1">
        <pre
          class="sourceCode bash"
        ><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">apk</span> add dovecot dovecot-pop3d isync postfix</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        Configure the dovecot server: <code>/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf</code>
      </p>
      <pre><code>protocols = pop3
mail_location = maildir:/mail
mail_privileged_group = mail
auth_mechanisms = plain
disable_plaintext_auth = no
ssl = no
pop3_client_workarounds = oe-ns-eoh outlook-no-nuls
pop3_deleted_flag = popped
pop3_delete_type = flag
pop3_fast_size_lookups = no
pop3_uidl_format = %08Xu%08Xv
log_path = /var/log/dovecot.log

passdb {
driver = passwd-file
args = scheme=PLAIN /etc/mailpasswd
}

userdb {
driver = passwd-file
args = /etc/mailpasswd
}

namespace inbox {
inbox = yes
separator = /
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        Note here that the dovecot server will source its authentication from a
        file at <code>/etc/mailpasswd</code>. I like to make the username and
        password the same as the one I use to log in to the Alpine Linux VM
        because that’s how postfix authenticates. Doing it this way makes for a
        more consistent experience.
      </p>
      <p>The dovecot authentication file <code>/etc/mailpasswd</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;YOUR USERNAME&gt;:{PLAIN}&lt;YOUR PASSWORD&gt;:1000:1000::/home/&lt;YOUR USERNAME&gt;::userdb_mail=maildir:/home/&lt;YOUR USERNAME&gt;/mail/ allow_nets=192.168.0.0/16,local,127.0.0.1/32</code></pre>
      <p>
        With dovecot in place and configured, now you need to get your email
        into the maildir. For some reason the executable for the isync package
        is called mbsync. This is a pretty simple configuration that only syncs
        the last 100 messages in the inbox from your account. I created a file
        at <code>~/.mbsyncrc</code>:
      </p>
      <pre><code>IMAPAccount brendonolaney
Host &lt;YOUR IMAP SERVER&gt;
Port &lt;YOUR IMAP PORT&gt;
UserCmd &quot;cat ~/.netrc | grep &#39;machine &lt;YOUR IMAP SERVER&gt;&#39; | awk &#39;FNR=1 {print $4}&#39;&quot;
PassCmd &quot;cat ~/.netrc | grep &#39;machine &lt;YOUR IMAP SERVER&#39; | awk &#39;FNR=1 {print $6}&#39;&quot;
SSLType IMAPS
SSLVersions TLSv1.3

IMAPStore remote
Account &lt;YOUR ACCOUNT NAME&gt;

MaildirStore local
Path /home/&lt;YOUR LOCAL USER NAME&gt;/mail
Inbox /home/&lt;YOUR LOCAL USER NAME&gt;/mail

Channel inbox
Far :remote:
Near :local:
MaxMessages 100
Create Near
SyncState *

Group &lt;YOUR ACCOUNT NAME&gt;
Channel inbox</code></pre>
      <p>
        For the <code>UserCmd</code> and <code>PassCmd</code> entries in the
        above configuration I created a <code>~/.netrc</code>:
      </p>
      <pre><code>machine &lt;YOUR EMAIL IMAP ADDRESS&gt; user &lt;YOUR EMAIL IMAP USERNAME&gt; pass &lt;YOUR EMAIL PASSWORD&gt;
machine &lt;YOUR EMAIL SMTP ADDRESS&gt; user &lt;YOUR EMAIL SMTP USERNAME&gt; pass &lt;YOUR EMAIL PASSWORD&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>
        It’s best practice to make this file only readable by your user account:
        <code>chmod 0600 ~/.netrc</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next we need to configure the postfix server with
        <code>/etc/postfix/main.cf</code>:
      </p>
      <pre><code>compatibility_level = 3.8
queue_directory = /var/spoll/postfix
command_directory = /usr/sbin
daemon_directory = /usr/libexec/postfix
data_directory = /var/lib/postfix
mail_owner = postfix
unknown_local_recipient_reject_code = 550
debug_peer_level = 2
debugger_command =
  PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin
  ddd $daemon_directory/$process_name $process_id &amp; sleep 5
sendmail_path = /usr/sbin/sendmail
newaliases_path = /usr/bin/newaliases
mailq_path = /usr/bin/mailq
setgid_group = postdrop
html_directory = no
manpage_directory = /usr/share/man
sample_directory = /etc/postfix
readme_directory = /usr/share/doc/postfix/readme
inet_protocols = ipv4
meta_directory = /etc/postfix
shlib_directory = /usr/lib/postfix

smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
mynetworks = 192.168.0.0/16
smtp_password_maps = static:&lt;YOUR EMAIL USERNAME&gt;:&lt;YOUR EMAIL PASSWORD&gt;
relayhost = &lt;YOUR SMTP SERVER&gt;:&lt;YOUR SMTP PORT&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>
        One last thing we need to do is configure isync to periodically fetch
        new messages from your email server by updating your cron file at
        <code>/etc/crontabs/&lt;YOUR USERNAME&gt;</code>:
      </p>
      <pre><code>*/1    *    *    *    *    mbsync -c ~/.mbsyncrc -a</code></pre>
      <p>
        Finally, all we need to do is add the dovecot and postfix services to
        Alpine’s launch daemons, and restart everything:
      </p>
      <pre><code>rc-update add dovecot
rc-update add postfix
rc-service dovecot restart
rc-service crond restart
rc-service postfix restart</code></pre>
      <p>
        Now all you should need to do is configure Netscape Communicator with
        your bridge’s IP address (run <code>ifconfig</code> on the bridge to get
        this), and the same username and password you use to log in to the
        bridge.
