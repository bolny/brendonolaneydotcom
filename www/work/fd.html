    <h1>A metrics calculation and storage system</h1>
    <p>
      The firm dashboard is a system that I implemented for Clio. It is an
      on-demand system that gathers data, transforms it, and reduces it into a
      set of metrics for rendering in a graph. I built it with modularity in
      mind so that new infrastructure may be added and used as a new data source
      or data store in the future.

    <p>
      The major technical hurdle for this project was calculating the values with
      minimal impact on the availability of the database and the performance of
      job runners in order to play nice with the other processes being managed by
      the job runner. To facilitate this I developed a job runner that allows us
      to control how jobs are processed in both parallel and in serial to allow
      us to strike the correct balance between the number of jobs running
      simultaneously and the length of each job on the system.
