    <p>Hi!</p>
    <p class="p-note">
      I am an ex-actor (ask me about my favourite Shakespeare play, it might
      surprise you!) who finally decided to give in and make my hobby into a
      career. I learned to use DOS around the same time I learned to read and
      that early exposure to electronics technology has dramatically shaped my
      life. From being the only one in the house that could figure out how to
      program the VCR to building applications at scale, if it involves
      electronics I have a keen interest in it.

    <h2>About This Website</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a bit sceptical about social media in general so a few years back I
      decided to create a place where I am fully in control of the content that
      can act as the one source of truth about me on the internet. My "web-home"
      as it were! I like to think that this site reflects how I like to approach
      things in both my personal life and in my work life. It is straight
      forward and uncomplicated. There is no flashy artwork, animations or
      technology here that didn't exist in the 90s (A bit brutalist in my
      opinion) and that is by design to make it easy to maintain. Even the
      images have been very compressed to save on bandwidth as well as energy
      usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally I had hosted this website using an operating system whose
      design and goals I really admire (OpenBSD), and a static site generator
      called Jekyll. I launched the site and promptly forgot about it since it's
      one of those things I want to be there but to not have to think much
      about. A couple of months later I got a security alert on my Github
      account that a library I was using had a security vulnerability, so I had
      to take some time away from what I wanted to be doing that day to fix it.
      Some time later OpenBSD updated and I needed to learn how to do the
      upgrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lesson that I took away from that experience was that if I want this
      thing to actually run, be available all the time, and spend as little time
      as possible maintaining it, is to do the simplest thing possible. So I
      relaunched the server using Debian Stable as the operating system (I've
      been using Debian for about 20 years now so while I'm by no means an
      expert I have very little to learn to accomplish simple tasks), and
      re-wrote the site in plain HTML. In general I think software developers
      have a tendency to over-engineer things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now all I have to to to keep this thing running is run a command every two
      years to update Debian. If I want to write new content I just edit an HTML
      file and commit it to git. As long as I keep paying the bills this thing
      should run forever.
