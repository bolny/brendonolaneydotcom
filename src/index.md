Hi!

::::{.p-note}
I am an ex-actor (ask me about my favourite Shakespeare play, it might
surprise you!) who finally decided to give in and make my hobby into a
career. I learned to use DOS around the same time I learned to read and
that early exposure to electronics technology has dramatically shaped my
life. From being the only one in the house that could figure out how to
program the VCR to building applications at scale, if it involves
electronics I have a keen interest in it.
