    <h1>A rewrite of a database report for performance</h1>
    <p>
      The invoice payments report rewrite was one of the first team projects
      that I led as a developer at Clio.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report is one of the most important for business operations. I had
      previously led a project to instrument the reporting system with
      monitoring, logging, and telemetry, which led us to identify this report
      as an under-performer. We profiled and bench-marked the existing report
      then built a prototype report that removed layers of abstraction to give
      us direct access to the data that we needed to build the report. We
      profiled and bench-marked the prototype to establish that building the
      full report would be a wise investment of resources. To establish
      correctness we created a complete set of inputs and outputs and built
      automated tests to enforce them. Once build was complete we did a final
      round of performance measurements and the result was a 1000% decrease in
      run time for the report.
