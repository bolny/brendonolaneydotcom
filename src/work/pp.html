    <h1>An abstraction layer for interacting with payments processors.</h1>

    <p>
      The payments platform is a system designed to provide a single touch point
      for applications to interact with one or more payments processors (Stripe,
      Paypal, etc.). It provides a single interface for creating, and managing
      things like charges, refunds, scheduled individual and recurring payments,
      managing fees, scheduling and handling payouts, customer onboarding, and
      more. If some of these features aren't provided by the processor, the
      payments platform provides them directly.

      News Release
    </a>

    <p>
      As a senior developer, I played a leadership role in driving the project
      to completion, through many phases, over its time in development. In
      particular, I brought a strong understanding of backend technologies and
      infrastructure architecture to help keep the system performant, processing
      asynchronously where possible, and identifying early potential scaling
      issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      One particularly interesting area of learning, for me, during the
      development of the payments platform was dealing with request idempotency
      and race conditions that can emerge when processing delays can result in a
      synchronous and asynchronous process occurring at the same time.
