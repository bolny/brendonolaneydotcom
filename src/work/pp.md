The payments platform is a system designed to provide a single touch point for
applications to interact with one or more payments processors (Stripe, Paypal,
etc.). It provides a single interface for creating, and managing things like
charges, refunds, scheduled individual and recurring payments, managing fees,
scheduling and handling payouts, customer onboarding, and more. If some of these
features aren’t provided by the processor, the payments platform provides them
directly.

[News Release][1]

As a senior developer, I played a leadership role in driving the project to
completion, through many phases, over its time in development. In particular, I
brought a strong understanding of backend technologies and infrastructure
architecture to help keep the system performant, processing asynchronously where
possible, and identifying early potential scaling issues.

One particularly interesting area of learning, for me, during the development of
the payments platform was dealing with request idempotency and race conditions
that can emerge when processing delays can result in a synchronous and
asynchronous process occurring at the same time.
