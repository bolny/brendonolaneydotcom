      <p>Store Locator</p>
    </header>

    <h1>
      A system to find and sort locations distance in Javascript, C#, and
      PostgreSQL/PostGIS
    </h1>

    <p>
      The store locator is unique in that it does not rely entirely on one
      service for it's operation. Whenever an address is added into the
      database, the <a href="./ae.html">Automation Engine</a> caches address
      data with geolocation coordinates (currently Google, but theoretically any
      service could substitute). When the store locator is queried, PostGIS does
      a great circle calculation to the nearest locations and returns with a top
      list including metadata. On the front end it overlays our data on top of a
      google map. However, since the data is ours, it would be trivial to switch
      to another service for visualization such as Apple Maps, or OpenStreetMap
      should usage terms change in the future.
