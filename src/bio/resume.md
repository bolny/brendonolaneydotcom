### Work Experience

#### Software Developer

##### [SocialNature] [1], Vancouver, BC, April 2017 - October 2018

I Worked initially to bring new features to the web site such as the Store Locator feature, and quickly moved into more mission critical tasks. My greatest achievement was the Automation Engine which enabled the company to be much more responsive to customer demand. We used a variant of the Agile methodolgy that focused on one week sprints, with a strong commitment to delivering promised units of work. The tech stack was C#, Dotnet Core, ASP.NET Core, EntityFramework, PostgreSQL, Angular, jQuery, Foundation, Git, and AWS.

#### Software Developer

##### Coho Data, Vancouver, BC, August 2016 - March 2017

My responsbilities included developing API endpoints, and front end for the web GUI for the Coho Data storage appliance. The tech stack was Flask, jQuery, Handlebars, and Backbone.js. We also began work on a ground-up re-implementation of the UI featuring an API defined in Swagger (still on top of Flask), and a brand new front end in React.

#### Web Developer

##### [Fortinet] [2], Burnaby, BC, August 2012 - August 2016

At Fortinet I developed the Web interface for the FortiAuthenticator security appliance. The stack was primarily Python/Django, PostgreSQL, and jQuery. However, I found it at times necessary to modify, or write operating system level libraries in C in order to add new features.
