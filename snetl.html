        A memory-efficient ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) framework in Python

        SNETL is modular and designed primarily to operate over large data sets
        and use a minimal amount of memory in order to keep costs low. It uses
        PostgreSQL streaming, and Amazon S3 multipart uploads to process data
        on a line-by-line basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        A SNETL module has four main components:
      </p>

      <ol class="descriptionlist">
        <li class="descriptionlist__item">
          A database query. It can be as simple or complex as needed.
        </li>
        <li class="descriptionlist__item">
          An ordered list of input columns from the query to enforce data
          integrity.
        </li>
        <li class="descriptionlist__item">
          A transformer class.
        </li>
        <li class="descriptionlist__item">
          An ordered list of output column.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The extractor performs a database query which is streamed in one row at
        a time and transformed into a dictionary using the ordered list. Then
        the dictionary is fed into a custom transformer class which is inspired
        by Django Model Forms. The base class for the transformer handles
        common operations such as data sanitization. Finally the loader creates,
        or adds to an Amazon S3 multipart upload.
      </p>

      <p>
        The SNETL framework has allowed us to quickly and efficiently make
        intelligence data available to operations using data visualization
        solutions such as Amazon Quicksight. Since its introduction we have
        seen a dramatic decrease in amount of developer time devoted to running
        database queries in order to surface intelligence data.
