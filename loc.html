        The store locator is unique in that it does not rely entirely on one
        service for it's operation. Whenever an address is added into the
        database, the <a href="./ae.html">Automation Engine</a> caches address
        data with geolocation coordinates (currently Google, but theoretically
        any service could substitute). When the store locator is queried,
        PostGIS does a great circle calculation to the nearest locations and
        returns with a top list including metadata. On the front end it overlays
        our data on top of a google map. However, since the data is ours, it
        would be trivial to switch to another service for visualization such as
        Apple Maps, or OpenStreetMap should usage terms change in the future.
